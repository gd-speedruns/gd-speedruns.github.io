# The Basics
Before you start running the game, there are a few things to make sure are set up and that you are aware of.

## Leaderboard Rules for PC
Before anything, ensure that you have a legitimate copy of Geometry Dash (pirated versions are possible, but are likely to have compatibility issues) and follow [this guide](https://www.speedrun.com/gmd/guide/lg6k8) to install LiveSplit and enable the Autosplitter. You also need to set up the splits (or the order of levels you will be beating in the run) with this program.
You will also need to enable the Steam FPS counter (the Mega Hack FPS counter is not disallowed, but the Steam FPS counter must be visible). Follow [this guide](https://www.speedrun.com/gmd/guide/e6ay2) for help with this.  
If you are using any version of Mega Hack for FPS Bypass, you will need to disable a large portion of the settings before doing a speedrun. [Here is a list](https://www.speedrun.com/gmd/guide/mxttx) of the settings you must disable.  
You must record your run with both video and audio. A suggested program for this is [Open Broadcaster Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (OBS) but it is far from the only option available.

## Leaderboard Rules for Mobile
Similar to PC, you must record a run with both video and audio.  
For shorter runs on iOS, this can be accomplished with the built-in recording function.  
Android emulators are allowed for speedrunning. An example is [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/).

## Optimal Settings
Firstly, on PC you will want to set your FPS correctly. You can compete on 60fps if you desire, but you will often be losing time (primarily to menuing) compared to higher framerates. It is worth it to note that skips on 60fps are generally easier to perform than on higher framerates, so it is not always the case you cannot get a world record on 60fps.  
The highest allowed framerate is 360fps. This is standard on the main level categories, but in some Gauntlets and the Map Pack categories a full 360fps run is not possible due to bugs in some levels. In such cases your framerate will need to chosen more carefully.

The Autosplitter on PC requires the <u>Percentage Bar</u> setting with <u>Show Percentage on</u>, and the sound effects on (greater than 0% sound).

You will want to have Smooth fix <u>off</u> in almost all circumstances: This setting causes the game to slow down if the game is lagging instead of dropping frames, which will always lose time. The setting has utility in some very specific situations, but in general it is best to have it off.

If you are running a Demon category, the timing method is with loads, so minimizing load times is important. For this, you will want to <u>turn off</u> both <u>Load Songs to Memory</u> and <u>High Capacity Mode</u>. Additionally, to fully minimize load times you will want to remove or avoid downloading songs if possible so loading the song is not required (this is particularly important if the song exceeds 8MB in size)

Finally, it may not have a significant effect but setting Graphics Quality to <u>Low</u> and enabling <u>Low Detail Mode</u> can improve FPS and lag on lower-end setups.
